# This file is sourced both at the end of my ~/.zshenv and at the top
# of my .zshrc.
#
# The objective of these commands is to take whatever the system-wide
# definition of the path is, prepend and append my custom path
# elements. However, especially in the case of the .zshrc, what is
# actually happening is a reshuffling of the order of my custom path
# elements to the front or back of the path. I have to do this
# because on OS X's system-wide /etc/zprofile it prepends all of the
# paths from /etc/paths{.d} to whatever I've previously set up in my
# ~/.zshenv

# Note: The order in which paths are prepended and appended is
# important.

# Define a function to move a path to the end or simply append the
# path if it isn't already in the path array.
append_path() {
    local dir="$1"
    # Remove the path from 'path' array
    path=(${path:#$dir})
    # Append the path to the end
    path+=("$dir")
}

# Define a function to prepend the path. This is trival, but wrappeed
# in a function to make it more symmetric to appending.
prepend_path() {
    local dir="$1"
    # Since path is typeset -U (unique array) only the first instance
    # of $dir will survive.
